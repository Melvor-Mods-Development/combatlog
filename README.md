# Combat Completion Log

Includes two different filters which are useful to track your progress:

- Can I get this item based on the skills I have unlocked?
- Can I get this item based on my current levels?

These filters are very useful for HCCO players, or even Adventurer accounts. The latter filter can be useful to see what items you're missing from your current level-situation.

## Install

Melvor Idle has a way to install mods automatically through the Melvor Mod Manager. The game should be found there.

To make an update, simply make a zip of all the files you want, including the manifest.json. More information is found at the [wiki page](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/w/Mod_Creation).
